Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
Shine like the sun
Raise your dreams for tomorrow
Beam through the sorrow
Shine like a star
I am your star commander
Reverse the gravity
I raise the golden banner
Proclaim prosperity
You are my stardust children
You are a gift of space
One million, billion, zillion
One entity, one race
A positive vibration
The science in my blood
A fake fur mutilation
Where ashes mix with mud
The mud compressed to diamonds
It's natural, it's queer
The message in the crystal
It's written loud and clear
Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
Shine like the sun
Raise your dreams for tomorrow
Beam through the sorrow
Shine like a star
The planets in procession
Reflect where stars collide
Soldiers of progression
All forces unified
Our legacy bombastic
A certain sacrifice
The universe fantastic
We enter paradise
Energy transmission
Apocalypse, hurray
A brand new world my vision
I mix my blood with clay
The clay compressed to diamonds
It's natural it's queer
The message in the crystal
It's written loud and clear
Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
Shine like the sun
Raise your dreams for tomorrow
Beam through the sorrow
Shine like a star
Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
Shine like the sun
Raise your dreams for tomorrow
Beam through the sorrow
Shine like a star
Shine like a star
Like a great ball of fire
Shine with desire
Live like a God
