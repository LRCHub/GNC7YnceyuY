Innocent, I appeal to
Judge me on my own will to
Resist you, you are my thrill
Shine like a star, don't go out, don't go out
Shine like a star, don't go out, don't go out
Innocent, I appeal to
Judge me on my own will to
Resist you, you are my thrill
Shine like a star, don't go out, don't go out
Shine like a star, don't go out, don't go out
