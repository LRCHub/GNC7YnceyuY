Forever and more
More than words could say (could say x7)

*If you shine, shine like a star
Then you'll know love's not so far
So take my hand and lift me higher
Let me feel your burning fire (fire x4)
Forever and more

Let your spirit
Take you higher, higher
Thrown across the sky
Take a journey
Up to heaven
Baby free your mind
Forever and more (x2)

More than words could say (could say x2)

*Repeat (x2)

Forever and more

After darkness
There is day light
Let me take your hand
And I will lead you
Up to heaven
To a wonderful

Forever and more (x2)

More than words could say (could say x2)

*Repeat (x2)

Forever and more
More than words could say (could say x4)

*Repeat (x4)

Forever and more
