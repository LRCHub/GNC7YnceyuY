Look at the world we live today
Look at the hurting everywhere
Let us see mercy and your grace
Overflowed in every place

Let us be one with you today
And let your glory fall

We will shine
Shine like stars above
Shining in your light
Guided by your love

Let your fire burn in us
Burning like the sun
As we glorify
Show your kingdom come
In all the earth

Teach us to live in righteousness
Teach us to love in one accord
Guide us to live life everyday
As we worship in your court

Let us declare your majesty
And let your glory fall

We will shine
Shine like stars above
Shining in your light
Guided by your love

Let your fire burn in us
Burning like the sun
As we glorify
Show your kingdom come
In all the earth

We will shine
Shine like stars above
Shining in your light
Guided by your love

Let your fire burn in us
Burning like the sun
As we glorify
Show your kingdom come
In all the earth

Look at the world we live today
Look at the hurting everywhere
Let us see mercy and your grace
Overflowed in every place

Let us be one with you today
And let your glory fall

We will shine
Shine like stars above
Shining in your light
Guided by your love

Let your fire burn in us
Burning like the sun
As we glorify
Show your kingdom come
In all the earth

Teach us to live in righteousness
Teach us to love in one accord
Guide us to live life everyday
As we worship in your court

Let us declare your majesty
And let your glory fall

We will shine
Shine like stars above
Shining in your light
Guided by your love

Let your fire burn in us
Burning like the sun
