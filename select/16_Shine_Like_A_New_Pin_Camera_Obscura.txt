Girl with a thick skin made you shine like a new pin
Why smother urges, which belong under dresses?
Do you wish that you could only start again
Learn to live and be pedestrian?
If all your wishes in the world come true
You'd be as good as new

What can I say that will make them jump to my defence?
I value honesty, I could never pretend
Crest fallen boys are boring
I don't know which way I'm going anymore
I can't be sure
